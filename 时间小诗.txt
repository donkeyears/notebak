纽约时间比加州时间早三个小时，
但加州时间并没有变慢。
有人22岁就毕业了，
但等了五年才找到稳定的工作！
有人25岁就当上CEO，
却在50岁去世。
也有人迟到50岁才当上CEO，
然后活到90岁。
有人单身，
同时也有人已婚。
奥巴马55岁就退休，
川普70岁才开始当总统。
世上每个人本来就有自己的发展时区。
身边有些人看似走在你前面，
也有人看似走在你后面。
但其实每个人在自己的时区有自己的步程。
不用嫉妒或嘲笑他们。
他们都在自己的时区里，你也是！
生命就是等待正确的行动时机。
所以，放轻松。
你没有落后。
你没有领先。
在你自己的时区里，一切安排都准时。

New York is 3 hours ahead of California, 
but it does not make California slow. 
Someone graduated at the age of 22, 
but waited 5 years before securing a good job! 
Someone became a CEO at 25, 
and died at 50. 
While another became a CEO at 50, 
and lived to 90 years. 
Someone is still single, 
while someone else got married. 
Obama retires at 55, 
but Trump starts at 70. 
Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone. 
People around you might seem to go ahead of you, 
some might seem to be behind you. 
But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME. 
Don't envy them or mock them. 
They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours! 
Life is about waiting for the right moment to act. 
So, RELAX. 
You're not LATE. 
You're not EARLY. 
You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE.
